Hi Laurie and Randall,


Just wanted to check in, with an email.


I have not yet, heard from you about our next Employment and Training
counseling appointment. Please, refer to the email I sent dated
August 21, 2023. I am bringing to your attention that my BC transit
bus pass is dated to expire on September, 9 2023.


Also, I am informing you that BC transit is denying me access to their
buses (with my temporary wheelchair replacement). This is a new
development since our last appointment. I have already informed you,
on my last appointment that poor lice (aka police) took my personal
items (including wheelchair and other) and have not yet returned them
to me.


Please, arrange for medicab (aka medical cab transport) or other
transportation options that you may have available.


Finally, I have not yet received any pickup email from you, for the
phone that you counseled me on acquiring, for communicating with
potential employers, workforce and department of labor career
counselor's and career fair organizer's.


As always, looking forward to and making myself available for our next
appointment, at your convenience.


Thanks again,
Rakesh.
