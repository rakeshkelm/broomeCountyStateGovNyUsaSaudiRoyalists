Hi Laurie,


Just wanted to follow up, with an email for our next Employment and Training
counseling appointment. I am making myself available at your
convenience (earliest is Tomorrow).


I have the intention and will to make all and every effort to make
myself able and available for training and employment. I pray to the
lord every day that thou shall bless me with good training and good
luck for great employment.


As always, available for our next appointment, at your convenience.


Thanks again,
Rakesh.
